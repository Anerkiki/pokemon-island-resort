# Pokemon Island Resort

---

## Introduction

---

I am looking to create this website to showcase a fictional tropical island resort designed for Pokémon and their trainers.

The goal is to creaate a visually engaging and appealing platform that captures the essence of a tropical getaway for Pokemon enthusiasts, which allows customers to get a feel for the resort, viewing the various activities the island has to offer, seeing and learning about the trainers, and booking suites/enrolling their Pokémon in classes.

View live website [here](https://anerkiki.github.io/pokemon-island-resort/) (Hosted on GitHub pages)

## Features

### Key Features

- **Fully Responsive at any screen size:** This includes a hero image that switches from landscape to portrait at mobile and tablet view, and text 'bubbles' that change order and location trainsitioning from different screen sizes, such as from mobile to laptop, and images which go from being inside the floating text bubbles, to outside, next to the text, in their own "bubbles".

---

### Site Wide Features

#### Navbar:
This has links to all of the main pages and is always fixed to the top, so is accessible from anywhere in the website. It has links to all of the pages (with exception to the Success/Thank You page - which you access after submitting any of the forms) - [see full list](#full-navbar-button-dropdown-list)

Below is an interactive feature to show you the buttons in the navbar and dropdown options of each (tap the arrow to see dropdown options):

### Pages
***Note:*** *Pages/sections marked with **\*** can be accessed through the navbar buttons or their dropdown menu options*

- **Home Page*** featuring:
  - A fun and colourful **Hero Image** with small 'Welcome' text bubble.
  - An **Activities** Section* with responsive "floating" text bubbles and images which multiply to up to 3, or appear inside the text boxes/bubbles at different screen sizes.
  - An **Our Trainers** Section* with group image, and then individual images, descriptions, and links to their classes, which are fully responsive, and the images also multiply to up to 3, or appear inside the text boxes/bubbles at different screen sizes.*
  - A **Contact Form*** to get in touch, with an adjustable message box, which links to the **Success/Thank You Page** when correctly submitted.

- **Suites Page*** featuring:
  - A large bubble **Page Title** which disappears and is instead incorporated into the navbar on smaller (mobile) devices.
  - **4 Suite Options*** with images, descriptions, [[[links to nearby activities??]]] and a 'Book Now' button, which links directly down to the Booking Form at the bottom of the page.
  - A Suite **Booking Form*** with dropdown menu to pick a suite to enquire about, which link to the **Success/Thank You Page** when correctly submitted.

- **Classes Page*** featuring:
  - **5 Class Options*** which are all fully responsive, so the image is inside the description box in a mobile/tablet screen, and then on larger screens the images pop out of the text box and appear beside, increasing/decreasing from 1 to 4 depending on the screen size, to match the height of the description bubble. As well as related images, these all have titles, descriptions, which trainer/trainers that will take the class (including a link to the specific trainer on the main home page), and a 'Book Now' button, which links directly down to the Booking Form at the bottom of the page.
  - A Class **Booking Form*** with dropdown menu to pick a suite to enquire about, which link to the **Success/Thank You Page** when correctly submitted.

- **Success/Thank You Page** feauturing:
  - A large bubble **Page Title** saying 'Thank You' which disappears and is instead incorporated into the navbar on smaller (mobile) devices.
  - A message of gratitude to the customer, including links to other places on the website that they can look at.
  - An image of all of the

## Design and Planning

---

**Design and Brand Identity**

The website is designed to have a fun, playful feel, and get potential visitors excited about everything the island has to offer.

Text bubbles, partially transparent with curved coloured chunky borders, and (at larger screen sizes) images with large chunky borders. These jump from left to right as you go down the page, a playful and quirky feel.

Lots of colour and images 

---

### User Experience/User Interface(UX/UI)

A typical customer will be:
- A pokemon owner
- Someone that likes to travel/try new things
- Young and up for adventure

#### User Stories

"As a past visitor to the resort I want to be able to show my friends and family an overview of what the resort has to offer, trianers I've met and experiences I've taken."

"As a new visitor to the site I want to see if the island will have everything I'm looking for and feel comfortable that I will enjoy my stay."

"As a new visitor to the site I want an easily navigatable site layout."

"As a vistor the site looking to contact the resort/book a class or suite, I need to feel confident that my message/request has been received."

### Wireframes

### Typography

**Fonts**

I wanted to pick a seaside-y/tropical/playful font for my headings etc, and I used **Google Fonts** to find one. I used their tool where you can write a specific phrase - in my case it was 'Pokémon Island Resort', as I knew this would be the main writing at the top of the page, so would be the most important to look right. I compared this title in many different fonts, especially what the (é) looks like, as it did look strange on a few of them, but I decided on 'Skranji' - as I feel exactly it has the exact exotic, tropical and beachy feel I wanted, and even reminded me slightly of bamboo used on island huts etc.

To pair with this, for a paragraph font, I wanted a simple, clear and unfussy font, that would compliment the heading font 'Skranji' without competing for attention, and again used **Google Fonts** to look through their sans-serif options and see what would work nicely. I chose 'Roboto', as it is a versatile and widely used sans-serif font designed for readability and legibility across different devices and screen sizes, balancing geometric shapes with open curves.

### Colour Scheme

**Background**
I wanted a sandy/beach/island feel for the website, so was thinking of a background in either a sand colour or a blue sea colour.

I liked the idea of having a background image, so decided to start by browsing through [link] to see if there was anything that could work. I decided this [background image](#background-photo) was right fit for my project and aesthetic as soon as I saw it. I instantly loved the colours from it and decided to pick the colours for the rest of the website from different parts of the image, as the colours were lovely and worked well together.

I did this using a Chrome extension called **ColorZilla** (add link to below?), which allowed me to use a dropper tool anywhere on the webpage, and told me the colour code of it. I did this with various colours, and then narrowed the choices down after viewing them on the webpage.

I saved each colour using `var(--colour-name)`.

**Header (including navbar) and Footer**

For the Header and Footer of the site, I decided I wanted it to have a bit of a bamboo shack feel, so started looking for images with horizontally lined up bamboo. Eventually found an image (link to bamboo image) I was happy with, but the colouring was wrong, so I decided to use an an partly overlay of one of the colours I'd decided on using before from the leaves the background image.

I decided to use this too for the footer, as it gave the site a bit more of a 'beach shack' type feel, and looked nice and dark enough for lighter content to show up well. 

**Font Colouring**

The only colour that wasn't from the background was the dark brown I chose for the paragraph text, as the rest of the colours were a bit light against the pale background apart from the leaf colour, but I was already planning to use this only on the header/footer, and some of the headings to make them pop, so it wasn't an option for the main bodies of text/description text colour.

I chose a dark brown, so that it doesn't clash or compete for attention from any of the more important headers, that I want the attention to initially be drawn to.

For this reason I kept the headings (Skranji) as more colourful, in a brighter green/golden sandy colour depending on the background shade, e.g. the bolder leaf colour on a paler background and the lighter sand colour on a darker background, so that the contrast is enough to be read easily.

I tested the colors using [wave link] [contrast test link], and amended the colours slightly later on so that I would pass tests that I'd failed with the previous colour. [this is mentioned here](link to #testing / #contrast#test)
