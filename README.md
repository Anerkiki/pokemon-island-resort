# Pokemon Island Resort

![Mockups of Home Page on various screen sizes](assets/images/readme/mockups/mockups-home-page.png)

I am looking to create this website to showcase a fictional tropical island resort designed for Pokémon and their trainers.

The goal is to create a visually engaging and appealing platform that captures the essence of a tropical getaway for Pokemon and Pokémon enthusiasts, which allows customers to get a feel for the resort, viewing the various activities the island has to offer, seeing and learning about the trainers, and booking suites/enrolling their Pokémon in classes.

# Design and Planning

## Objectives

The main objectives of the Pokemon Island Resort website are:

- **Showcase the Resort:** Present a vibrant, engaging overview of the fictional island resort, highlighting its unique features, activities, and accommodations for both Pokémon and their trainers.
- **Enhance User Engagement:** Create an interactive and visually appealing experience that encourages users to explore the site, learn about the trainers, and discover the variety of classes and suites available.
- **Facilitate Booking Requests and Inquiries:** Provide clear, accessible forms for users to enquire to book suites, enroll Pokémon in classes, or contact the resort, ensuring a smooth and user-friendly process.
- **Promote Accessibility and Responsiveness:** Ensure the website is fully responsive and accessible across all devices and screen sizes, offering an optimal experience for every visitor.
- **Build Trust and Credibility:** Use professional design, clear navigation, and transparent information to build user confidence in the resort and its offerings.

These objectives should guide the design, content, and functionality of the website to deliver a memorable and effective user experience.

---

## Design and Brand Identity

The website is designed to have a fun, playful feel, aiming to get potential visitors excited about everything the island has to offer. The overall aesthetic draws inspiration from tropical resorts and the vibrant world of Pokémon, using bright, cheerful colours and whimsical design elements throughout.

A key part of the design is the use of text bubbles - these are partially transparent with curved, chunky colored borders that help them stand out against the background. On larger screens, images are also framed with thick, colorful borders, creating a cohesive and lively look. The layout is intentionally dynamic: as you scroll down the page, the text bubbles and images alternate from left to right, giving the site a playful, quirky, and engaging flow that encourages exploration.

To further enhance the playful atmosphere, I incorporated a variety of colorful images. These visuals not only make the site more visually appealing but also help communicate the resort's unique offerings and the sense of adventure awaiting visitors. The combination of bold typography, vibrant color palette, and interactive elements (like dropdown menus and responsive layouts) ensures that the site feels welcoming and accessible to users of all ages, especially Pokémon fans and trainers looking for a fun getaway with their Pokémon.

Overall, every design choice - from the fonts and colours to the arrangement of content was made to capture the essence of a tropical Pokémon paradise, making the website both inviting and memorable.

## Typography/Fonts

I wanted to pick a playful and tropical font with a seaside feel for my headings, so I used **Google Fonts** to explore options. Using their preview tool, I tested the phrase "Pokémon Island Resort" - the main site title - to ensure it looked just right, especially the (é) character, which appeared odd in some fonts. I ultimately chose 'Skranji' because it perfectly captures the exotic, tropical, and beachy vibe I wanted, and even has a hint of bamboo reminiscent of island shacks.

For paragraph text, I wanted a simple, clear, and unfussy font that would complement 'Skranji' without competing for attention. Again using **Google Fonts**, I browsed sans-serif options and selected 'Roboto' for its versatility and readability across devices. Its straightforward design and spacious lettering make it easy to read, even in longer paragraphs.

---

## Colour Scheme/Design

### Background

I wanted the website's colour scheme to evoke a welcoming and relaxing island holiday feeling, so I decided on a background in either a sandy tone or a blue sea colour.

I also liked the idea of having a background image, so I began by searching on some of the free image websites for a suitable image that would set the tone for the site. After browsing through a few options, I found a [background image](#background-photo) on [Freepik](https://www.freepik.com/) that felt like it perfectly matched the tropical vibe I envisioned. I instantly loved the colours in this image (and how well they worked together) - from the golden sand background colour, the vibrant green of the palm leaves, and the range of other colours in the smaller details such as the shells and footprints - and decided to make a colour palette from these to use throughout the website for consistency.

To be able to use each of these specific colours from the image throughout the website, I used the [ColorZilla Chrome Extension](https://www.colorzilla.com/), which allowed me to pinpoint and extract exact colour codes directly from any online image. I added many different colours, then refined my choices by previewing them on the site to ensure they complemented each other and provided good contrast.

### Colour Pallet

![Colour Pallet](assets/images/readme/colour-pallet.jpg)

For future maintainability, I defined each colour as a CSS variable (e.g., `var(--colour-name)`). This approach made it easy to update the palette later if needed - changing a single variable would update the colour everywhere it was used. This was especially helpful when testing text contrast for accessibility, as did end up changing the colour I had selected for the paragraph text when testing against the background colour of the text 'bubbles', so that it would pass all of the tests in the [add link] contrast test as it didn't originally.

I also used a couple of colours outside of this colour pallet, one which was a shade in between 2 of the colours from my colour pallet, and one which is a lighter version of the original - in places where the original colours didn't look quite right (either too light or too dark).

I used a [Color Blender tool](https://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/color-blend/#FFD8B7:FEEDDC:5:hex) to find a colour between my `--primary-sand` and `--secondary-sand` colours by inputting their 2 hex codes - producing the perfect middle tone which I named `--tertiary-sand`.

<!-- add a bit about the colour lightener I used -->

<details>
<summary>Click for Image of Color Blender showing the two colours I inputted to find midpoint colour</summary>

![Color Blender showing the two colours I inputted to find midpoint colour](assets/images/readme/tools/color-blender.png)
</details><br>

### Font Colouring

The only colour (in the Colour Pallet) not from the background image was the dark brown shade `#674A18`, originally `#84644B`, which I chose because all of the other colours (apart from the leaf colour) were too pale to stand out against a pale sandy background (which I used as a background for all blocks of text), and it still matches the aesthetic nicely, but doesn't compete for attention from any of the more important headers, that I want the attention to initially be drawn to.

For this reason I kept the headings (Skranji) as more colourful, in a brighter green/golden sandy colour depending on the background shade, e.g. the bolder leaf colour on a paler background and the lighter sand colour on a darker background, so that the contrast is enough to be read easily.

I tested the colors using [WebAIM Contrast Checker Test](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker), and amended the colours slightly later on so that I would pass tests that I'd failed with the previous colour. [This is where I show the Contrast Test Outcomes](#webaim-contrast-checker-test) in the [Testing](#testing) section.

<!-- Another Title? -->

### Favicon

The favicon for this site is a small palm tree icon, chosen to reflect the tropical island theme of the resort. It appears in the browser tab and bookmarks, helping users quickly identify the site. The favicon was sourced from IconArchive and is free to use under an open source license. Its playful design complements the overall branding and adds a professional touch to the website.

### Header/Navbar and Footer

For the Header and Footer of the site, I decided I wanted it to have a bit of a bamboo shack feel, so started looking for images with horizontally lined up bamboo. Eventually found an image (link to bamboo image) I was happy with, but the colouring was wrong, so I decided to use an an partly overlay of one of the colours I'd decided on using before from the leaves the background image.

I decided to use this too for the footer, as it gave the site a bit more of a 'beach shack' type feel, and looked nice and dark enough for lighter content to show up well.

# Features

## Key Features

- **Fully Responsive at any screen size:** This includes a hero image that switches from landscape to portrait at mobile and tablet view, and text 'bubbles' that change order and location trainsitioning from different screen sizes, such as from mobile to laptop, and images which go from being inside the floating text bubbles, to outside, next to the text, in their own "bubbles".
<!-- - **Responsive Design**: Ensures the website is accessible and visually appealing on all devices, including mobile, tablet, and desktop. -->

[HeroExample]

<details>
<summary>Example at small screen sizes (tablet & mobile) - showing the image inside the text box</summary>

![Responsive Images on Small Screens](assets/images/readme/responsiveness-screenshots/responsive-images-small.png)
</details>

<details>
<summary>Example at medium screen sizes (small laptop) - showing 4 images to match the text height, now to the side of the text box</summary>

![Responsive Images on Medium Screens](assets/images/readme/responsiveness-screenshots/responsive-images-medium.png)
</details>

<details>
<summary>Example at large screen sizes (laptop) - showing 3 images to match the text height, to the side of the text box</summary>

![Responsive Images on Medium Screens](assets/images/readme/responsiveness-screenshots/responsive-images-large.png)
</details>

<details>
<summary>Example at XL screen sizes (monitor/TV) - showing 2 images to match the text height, to the side of the text box</summary>

![Responsive Images on Medium Screens](assets/images/readme/responsiveness-screenshots/responsive-images-xl.png)
</details>

The paragraphs inside the text box and images are all inside a Bootstrap flexbox, which will adjust to the screen size accordingly, and if gaps are needed, they will be evenly distributed between so there are never any large unsightly gaps, no matter the viewing dimensions.

# Testing

## Lighthouse Performance

When testing my website with Lighthouse, I encountered an issue, which I fixed (fixed scores below) which affected the 'Best Practices' score, as shown below:

<details>
<summary>Click for old test results</summary>

![Issue Description](assets/images/readme/testing/lighthouse/lighthouse-best-practices-issue.png)
</details><br>

This was due to `h1` elements being used within a `section` element, so by changing all the `h2`s to `h3`s and `h1`s in my `section`s to `h2`s, this fixed the issue, giving me the scores below for each of the pages:

## WAVE Test

## WebAIM Contrast Checker Test

I changed the original dark brown colour I had chosen for my paragraph text colour after testing from `#84644B` to `#674A18` due to the original colour not passing all of the contrast checker tests on the [WebAIM Contrast Checker](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/) website, and I wanted my website to be as accessible as possible for all users.

Below is an image of the new, slightly darker brown colour passing all of the tests on this website:

# Fixed Issues
<!-- Problems/Challenges/Bugs -->

### VS Code Extension *'Prettier'* adding unneccessary closing tags

<details>
<summary>Issue & Solution:</summary>

**Issue:** As part of the course material, I installed a code refactoring extension called 'Prettier' in VS Code, but had issues with this adding unneccessary closing tags (`/>`) to all of the self-closing elements, such as `meta` and `img`.

These were added every time I formatted my pages, and resulted in errors in the [W3C Testing](#w3c-markuphtml-validation-service) stage, wasting time with having to remove each time I formatted.

**Solution:** I uninstalled this extension and opted to use the default formatter, which worked a lot better.
</details>

---

### Unable to change/remove background of Navbar
<details>
<summary>Issue & Solution:</summary>

**Issue:** When I had added the bamboo background image to the header section, I noticed the navbar from Bootstrap I had added within this had it's own white colour background, which stopped the image being shown as a background for the whole thing, even if I tried to change it to transparent using my CSS stylesheet.

![Navbar background being overridden by Bootstrap](assets/images/readme/issue/issue-removing-navbar-background.png)

**Solution:** I checked using Devtools and noticed that the background colour was being set my a bootstrap scss file, and that this was set as `!important;` so would override any background I added. Looking further I spotted it was being added because of the `bg-body-tertiary` class, so once I removed this, the background image covered the whole title & nav section, including the navbar.
![Code causing the issue](assets/images/readme/issue/issue-removing-navbar-background-code.png)
</details>

### Page Title inside Navbar not appearing centralised

<details>
<summary>Issue & Solution:</summary>

**Issue:** Because of the burger icon being to the right of the same navbar section that the page title appears in on smaller screens (mobile and tablet), the title wasn't appearing centralised, it was being pushed too far to the left.

**Solution:** I fixed this by adding padding to the left of the page title which matched the width of the burger icon, centralising it correctly to match the title above.
I added a class to the page title, and added `padding-left` of the same width of the burger icon.

| Page Title too far to the left: | Page title centralised with left-padding added: |
| :---: | :---: |
| ![Page Title with no padding](assets/images/readme/issue/page-title-center/issue-page-title-no-padding.png) | ![Page Title centralised with left padding](assets/images/readme/issue/page-title-center/issue-page-title-left-padding.png) |
```css
.page-title {
    padding-left: 28.4px;
}
```
This also had to be amended to match the burger icon's new width on a larger screen as I added padding to the x-axis at the mobile to tablet breakpoint. I checked the width of the burger icon at each breakpoint using Chrome DevTools (shown below).
| Smaller burger icon without added padding in the x-axis: | Smaller burger icon with added padding in the x-axis: |
| :---: | :---: |
| ![Smaller burger icon without added padding in the x-axis](assets/images/readme/issue/page-title-center/issue-burger-icon-small.png) | ![Smaller burger icon with added padding in the x-axis](assets/images/readme/issue/page-title-center/issue-burger-icon-large.png) |
```css

### Dropdown Menu in navbar being cut off

<details>
<summary>Issue & Solution:</summary>

**Issue:**  When the right dropdown menu is opened, some of the menu text is cut off by the edge of the screen. This occurs because the dropdown button is positioned close to the screen edge, and the menu options are too long to fit within the visible area. By default, Bootstrap dropdown menus are left-aligned. If a dropdown is near the right edge and the menu options are lengthy, the menu will overflow and appear clipped, making some text not fully visible.

![Dropdown Menu being cut off](assets/images/readme/issue-right-align1.png)

**Solution:**  After consulting the Bootstrap documentation, I discovered that adding the `dropdown-menu-end` class to the same element as `dropdown-menu` changes the alignment of the dropdown menu to the right, instead of the default left alignment. This prevents the menu from being cut off at the edge of the screen. I applied this fix only to the two rightmost navbar dropdown menus, while keeping the left-side dropdowns left-aligned. This approach maintains visual consistency across the navbar and avoids potential overflow issues on either side.

Later, I also updated the navbar alignment to better match the rest of the site's layout by changing `container-fluid` to `container` in the navbar, which added more space between the buttons and edges of the screen and helped the navbar appear more consistent with the more centralised page content.

### Text box/bubble height mismatched with height of images

**Issue:** At certain screen sizes, the text box was either too long or too short compared to the adjacent images, causing unwanted gaps, either between images or within the text box.

**Solution:** I solved this problem by setting some of the images to appear/disappear depending on the size of the screen, using bootstrap classes.

```html
CODE HERE
```

I also added space between images with [code] so that the gap was dispersed between each image, making it appear less, rather than showing as an obvious gap at the bottom.

I then did the same to the titles, paragraphs and buttons in the text boxes/bubbles by ...

# Deployment
<!-- Maybe make numbered list -->
- Firstly, I made a new repository in GitHub from the code institute template, with my chosen name for my project, which is `pokemon-island-resort`
    - I ensured that this was in snake case so it would all be coordinated.
- Once I had made a new repository, in *File Explorer* on my local device, I then navigated to the folder I wanted my project to be in, and right clicked to ‘Open in Terminal’

![image](assets/images/readme/deployment-creating.png)

- Then, after making sure I was still in the correct folder, I typed `git clone [link copied from GitHub]`

![image](assets/images/readme/deployment-terminal1.png)

![image](assets/images/readme/deployment-terminal2.png)

- Now a new folder has been added which is linked to the GitHub repository

![image](assets/images/readme/deployment-folder.png)

- I then opened my new folder in VS Code, added some of the starter files such as `index.html` and the `assets` & `css` folders, linked to bootstrap, font awesome, and linked my own custom css sheets, where I also added in my chosen fonts from google fonts, and added colours and fonts to the stylesheet to make sure these were all linked correctly.
- I then added, committed and pushed the changes to my GitHub repository.
