# Pokémon Island Resort

![Mockups of Home Page on various screen sizes](assets/images/readme/mockups/home-page.png)

I am looking to create this website to showcase a fictional tropical island resort with classes and activities designed for Pokémon and their trainers.

The goal is to create a visually engaging and appealing platform that captures the essence of a tropical getaway for Pokémon and Pokémon enthusiasts, which allows customers to get a feel for the resort, viewing the various activities the island has to offer, seeing and learning about the trainers, and booking suites/enrolling their Pokémon in classes.

# Design and Planning

---

## Objectives

The main objectives of the Pokémon Island Resort website are:

- **Showcase the Resort:** Present a vibrant, engaging overview of the fictional island resort, highlighting its unique features, activities, and accommodations for both Pokémon and their trainers.
- **Enhance User Engagement:** Create an interactive and visually appealing experience that encourages users to explore the site, learn about the trainers, and discover the variety of classes and suites available.
- **Facilitate Booking Requests and Enquiries:** Provide clear, accessible forms for users to enquire to book suites, enroll Pokémon in classes, or contact the resort, ensuring a smooth and user-friendly process.
- **Promote Accessibility and Responsiveness:** Ensure the website is fully responsive and accessible across all devices and screen sizes, offering an optimal experience for every visitor.
- **Build Trust and Credibility:** Use professional design, clear navigation, and transparent information to build user confidence in the resort and its offerings.

These objectives should guide the design, content, and functionality of the website to deliver a memorable and effective user experience.

---

## Design and Brand Identity

The website is designed to have a fun, playful feel, aiming to get potential visitors excited about everything the island has to offer. The overall aesthetic draws inspiration from tropical resorts and the vibrant world of Pokémon, using bright, cheerful colours and whimsical design elements throughout.

A key part of the design is the use of text bubbles - these are partially transparent with curved, chunky coloured borders that help them stand out against the background. On larger screens, images are also framed with the same thick, coloured borders, creating a cohesive look. The layout is intentionally dynamic: as you scroll down the page, the text bubbles and images alternate from left to right, giving the site a playful, quirky, and engaging flow that encourages exploration.

To further enhance the lively and playful atmosphere, I incorporated a variety of colourful images. These visuals not only make the site more visually appealing but also help communicate the resort's unique offerings and the sense of adventure awaiting visitors. The combination of bold typography, vibrant colour palette, and interactive elements (like dropdown menus and responsive layouts) ensures that the site feels welcoming and accessible to users of all ages, especially Pokémon fans and trainers looking for a fun getaway with their Pokémon.

Overall, every design choice - from the fonts and colours to the arrangement of content was made to capture the essence of a tropical Pokémon paradise, making the website both inviting and memorable.

|  | *I removed some of the extra text bubbles that will be on <br>the finished website so that the image isn't too long* |
</details>

**Changes I made to this page**

I decided to change the 'Island Features' title to 'Our Activities' instead to be more exciting and engaging for potential customers. The term 'Island Features' felt a bit generic and didn't fully capture the fun, adventurous spirit I wanted to convey. By renaming it to 'Our Activities', the section immediately communicates that there are a variety of things to do at the resort, inviting visitors to imagine themselves taking part in these experiences.

I also changed the section title from 'Our Trainers and Pokémon' to just 'Our Trainers' to streamline the layout and make it more concise. Instead of listing both trainers and Pokémon together, I opted to highlight the trainers in the main section, and then specify which Pokémon are involved in each class within the relevant text bubbles.

I also decided to add a 'Contact Us' button to the left of the navbar menu, as thought this would be better to be more immediately visible for users of the website, and then decided to change the navbar menu button names so they were shorter and more concise (from 'About Us' to 'Home', 'Our Trainers' to 'Trainers' and 'Contact Us' to 'Contact'), taking less room and balancing better with the longer buttons on the right side 'Book a Room' and 'Book a Class'.

### Rooms (/Suites) Page

</details>

**Changes I made to this page**

Later, I decided to change the name of this page from 'Rooms' to 'Suites', as I felt having apartments and chalets, etc. would give a more luxurious feel than simply having rooms to book.

I also decided to simplify this page to keep the images inside the boxes at both screen sizes, instead of popping out to be at the side, like I have in my Home and Classes pages, as I was only using 1 image per room, so it worked better at all screen sizes.

**Changes to both this page and the Classes Page**

I decided to change the titles in the Rooms and Classes pages, instead of having both a page title in the navbar and on the main page to the navbar page title only showing at smaller screens, and switching to a larger title bubble at larger screens, so that the titles weren't duplicated and made best use of the available screen space.

I also changed the navbar button options in these pages to reduce the 2/3 dropdown buttons on the left side of the navbar (was 'About Us' & 'Our Trainers', then 'Home', 'Trainers' and 'Contact') to just 1 normal 'Back to Home' button, and also changed the other page button on the right side to be a normal button instead of a dropdown button, leaving only dropdown buttons for the active page, which made navigating simpler and cleaner.

## Typography/Fonts

I wanted to pick a playful and tropical font with a seaside feel for my headings, so I used **Google Fonts** to explore options. Using their preview tool, I tested the phrase "Pokémon Island Resort" - the main site title - to ensure it looked just right, especially the (é) character, which appeared odd in some fonts. I ultimately chose **Skranji** because it perfectly captures the exotic, tropical, and beachy vibe I wanted, and even has a hint of bamboo reminiscent of island shacks.


For paragraph text, I wanted a simple, clear, and unfussy font that would complement 'Skranji' without competing for attention. Again using **Google Fonts**, I browsed sans-serif options and selected **Roboto** for its versatility and readability across devices. Its straightforward design and spacious lettering make it easy to read, even in longer paragraphs.

| Header Font | Paragraph Font |
| :---: | :---: |
| ![Skranji Font](assets/images/readme/design/font-skranji.png) | ![Roboto Font](assets/images/readme/design/font-roboto.png) |

---

## Colour Scheme/Design

**Images and Colours**

I wanted the website's colour scheme to evoke a welcoming and relaxing island holiday feeling, so I decided on a background in either a sandy tone or a blue sea colour.

I also liked the idea of having a background image, so I began by searching on some of the free image websites for a suitable image that would set the tone for the site. After browsing through a few options, I found a [background image](#background-image-for-main-sections) on [Freepik](https://www.freepik.com/) that felt like it perfectly matched the tropical vibe I envisioned. I instantly loved the colours in this image (and how well they worked together) - from the golden sand background colour, the vibrant green of the palm leaves, and the range of other colours in the smaller details such as the shells and footprints - and decided to make a colour palette from these to use throughout the website for consistency.

To be able to use each of these specific colours from the image throughout the website, I used [ColorZilla](https://www.colorzilla.com/), which is a Chrome extension that allows you to select specific colours from a webpage using a dropper tool, to get the specific hex code/rgb code directly from any online image. I added many different colours, then refined my choices by previewing them on the site to ensure they complemented each other and provided good contrast.

For the Header and Footer, I wanted to evoke the feel of a 'bamboo beach shack', so I searched for images featuring horizontally aligned bamboo. 

I eventually found a [bamboo image](#bamboo-image-used-as-header-and-footer-background) that fit the look I wanted, but its original colors didn't quite match my chosen palette, so I decided to create a semi-transparent colored overlay using one of the palette colors extracted from the background image over the top of the bamboo background image by changing the hex code to an rgba code, where I can manipulate the opacity, and adding it as a background to another div I added on top. This allowed the bamboo texture to remain visible while ensuring the overall color scheme stayed consistent. The overlay also improves the readability of button text and titles against the background.

</details>

**Favicon**

The favicon for this site is a small palm tree icon, chosen to reflect the tropical island theme of the resort. It appears in the browser tab and bookmarks, helping users quickly identify the site. The favicon was sourced from IconArchive and is free to use under an open source license. Its playful design complements the overall branding and adds a professional touch to the website.

### Colour Palette

![Colour Palette](assets/images/readme/design/colour-palette.jpg)

For future maintainability, I defined each colour as a CSS variable (e.g., `var(--colour-name)`). This approach made it easy to update the palette later if needed - changing a single variable would update the colour everywhere it was used. This was especially helpful when testing text contrast for accessibility, as I did end up changing the colour I had selected for the paragraph text when testing against the background colour of the text 'bubbles', so that it would pass all of the tests in the [WebAIM Contrast Checker Test](#webaim-contrast-checker-test) as it didn't originally.

I also used a couple of colours outside of this colour palette, one which was a shade in between 2 of the colours from my colour palette, and one which is a lighter version of the original - in places where the original colours didn't look quite right (either too light or too dark).

I used a [Color Blender tool](https://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/color-blend/#FFD8B7:FEEDDC:5:hex) to find a colour between my `--primary-sand` and `--secondary-sand` colours by inputting their 2 hex codes - producing the perfect middle tone which I named `--tertiary-sand`.

<summary>Click for Image of Color Blender showing the two colours I inputted to find midpoint colour</summary>

![Color Blender showing the two colours I inputted to find midpoint colour](assets/images/readme/tools/color-blender.png)
</details>

### Font Colouring

The only colour (in the Colour Palette) not picked from the background image was the dark brown shade `#674A18`, originally `#84644B`, which I chose because all of the other colours (apart from the leaf colour) were too pale to stand out against a pale sandy background (which I used as a background for all blocks of text), and it still matches the aesthetic nicely, but doesn't compete for attention from any of the more important headers, that I want the attention to initially be drawn to.

For this reason I kept the headings (Skranji) as more colourful, in a brighter green/golden sandy colour depending on the background shade, e.g. the bolder leaf colour on a paler background and the lighter sand colour on a darker background, so that the contrast is enough to be read easily.

I tested the colours using [WebAIM Contrast Checker Test](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker), and amended the colours slightly later on so that I would pass tests that I'd failed with the previous colour. [This is where I show the Contrast Test Outcomes](#webaim-contrast-checker-test) in the [Testing](#testing) section.

# Features

## Key Features

### Accessible for screen readers/visually impaired

I added aria-labels to all links on the website and ensured that even sections without a header had a hidden visibility header which made it clear what the section was for.

### Fully Responsive at any screen size:
Ensures the website is accessible and visually appealing on all devices, including mobile, tablet, and desktop.

This includes:
- A hero image that switches from landscape to portrait when shrinking from laptop to mobile/tablet screen size.
- Text 'bubbles' that change order and location transitioning from different screen sizes, with images which go from being inside the floating text bubbles, to outside, next to the text, in their own "bubbles" and also change order and visibility depending in the screen size.

| Hero Image on smaller screens (mobile & tablet): | Hero Image on large screens (laptop & larger): |
| :---: | :---: |
| ![Hero Image on smaller screens](assets/images/readme/features/hero-small.png) | ![Hero Image on large screens](assets/images/readme/features/hero-large.png) |

**Examples of how images change depending on screen size to match the text box height**:

|  |  |
| :---: | :---: |
| Small screen sizes (tablet & mobile) - showing 1 image inside the text box | Medium screen sizes (small laptop) - now with 4 images to the side of the text box |
| ![Responsive Images on Small Screens](assets/images/readme/features/responsive-images-small.png) | ![Responsive Images on Medium Screens](assets/images/readme/features/responsive-images-medium.png) |
| Large screen sizes (laptop) - now with 3 images to the side of the text box | XL screen sizes (monitor/TV) - now with 2 images to the side of the text box |
| ![Responsive Images on Medium Screens](assets/images/readme/features/responsive-images-large.png) | ![Responsive Images on Medium Screens](assets/images/readme/features/responsive-images-xl.png) |

The paragraphs inside the text box and images are all inside a Bootstrap flexbox, which adjusts to the screen size. If gaps are needed, they are evenly distributed, so there are never any large unsightly gaps, no matter the viewing dimensions."

---

## Site Wide Features

### Navbar:

This has links to all of the main pages and is always fixed to the top, so is accessible from anywhere in the website. It has links to all of the pages (with exception to the Success and 404 pages) - [see full list](#full-navbar-button-dropdown-list)

Below is an interactive feature to show you the buttons in the navbar and dropdown options of each (tap the arrow to see dropdown options):

| ![Full Sized Footer](assets/images/readme/features/footer-full-size.png) | ![Collapsed Footer](assets/images/readme/features/footer-collapsed.png) |

### No Break Spaces

I added no break spaces (`&nbsp;`) to the end of all paragraphs between the last 2 (sometimes 3 if short) words so there aren't ever any 'orphan' words, no matter the screen size - which makes blocks of text look a lot better always.

![No Break Spaces in HTML code](assets/images/readme/features/nbsp-in-html.png)

| Before | After |
| ![Before adding No Break Spaces](assets/images/readme/features/nbsp-before.png) | ![After adding No Break Spaces](assets/images/readme/features/nbsp-after.png) |

### Universal Spacing

Instead of adding margins/padding/gaps to individual elements using Bootstrap classes, like I was doing at the start, I decided to instead add these to my custom `style.css` stylesheet, so that these would be automatically passed down or I could add multiple changes with a simple custom class instead.

Instead of having lots of different classes that applied specific spacing, that were the same on multiple elements, I decided to add spacing like this to a new CSS class or onto as an element rule in my stylesheet.

```html
<div class="my-5 mt-2 px-4 pb-2 pt-0">
```

The new class: `.floating-section` below, I used for spacing inside all my text bubbles:

```css
.floating-section {
    gap: 10px;
    padding: 24px;
}
```
Images showing the spacing applied due to the above class, such as padding (in green) and gaps (in purple):

| :---: | :---: |
| ![An example of the spacing applied to a text bubble](assets/images/readme/features/universal-spacing/bubble-chalet.png) | ![An example of the spacing applied to a form](assets/images/readme/features/universal-spacing/form-spacing.png) |

I also added spacing to the `body`,`main` and `section` elements. This image shows some of the rules I added to some of these elements:

```css
main {
    gap: 10px;
}

section {
    margin: 0 20px;
    padding: 10px 0;
    width: 99%;
}
```

| :---: | :---: |
| ![Page spacing before](assets/images/readme/features/universal-spacing/body-before.png) | ![Page spacing after](assets/images/readme/features/universal-spacing/body-after.png) |

The spacing was particularly helpful to space the content and add padding inside and in between the multiple text bubbles, to ensure nothing got too cramped and make sure everything stays consistent, no matter the screen size.

## Pages
***Note:*** *Pages/sections marked with **\*** can be accessed through the navbar buttons or their dropdown menu options*

**Home Page*** - Highlights the resort's unique offerings and provides a welcoming introduction.

Featuring:
- A fun and colourful **Hero Image** with small floating 'Welcome' text bubble.
- Different Navbar options depending on the screen size.
- A responsive Hero image that changes orientation at different sizes to fill the screen (portrait for mobile/tablet and landscape for laptop and larger screens).

![Mockups of Home Page on various screen sizes](assets/images/readme/mockups/home-page.png)

- An **Activities** Section* with responsive floating text bubbles and images which multiply to up to 3 depending on the height of the text bubble, or appear inside the text bubbles at mobile and tablet screen sizes.

  - The image below shows a way to jump to this section from anywhere on the Home page - an open 'Our Activities' dropdown menu option from opening the 'Home' dropdown menu in the navbar, which is being hovered over so the colour has inverted.

![Mockups of Home Page Activities Section on various screen sizes](assets/images/readme/mockups/home-page-activities.png)

- An **Our Trainers** Section* with group image, and then individual images, descriptions, and links to their classes, which are fully responsive, and the images also multiply to up to 3, or appear inside the text bubbles at different screen sizes.
  - You can get to this section of the Home page by clicking the 'Trainers' button, or selecting the 'Our Trainers' option in the Home dropdown menu.
  - As you can see on the largest screen in the image below, when the 'Trainers' button is hovered over, there is a hover effect that changes the colouring/background, like in the dropdown menus.

![Mockups of Home Page Trainers Section on various screen sizes](assets/images/readme/mockups/home-page-trainers.png)

- A **Contact Form*** to get in touch, with an adjustable message box, which links to the **Success/Thank You Page** when correctly submitted.

  - This image shows one of the dropdown menu options that directs to the contact form from the 'Contact' split button dropdown menu.<br>
*(you can also use the Contact button or 'Send Us a Message' option in the Contact dropdown menu)*

![Mockups of Home Page Contact Form on various screen sizes](assets/images/readme/mockups/home-page-form.png)

- All pages are also responsive so that the center content won't stretch too large on XXL Screens.

![The Home Page on XXL Screens](assets/images/readme/mockups/xxl-screens.png)

---

**Suites Page*** - Lists the suites, complete with descriptions and images, and also has a booking request form.

Featuring:
- A large bubble **Page Title** which disappears and is instead incorporated into the navbar on smaller screen sizes.
- **4 Suite Options*** with images, descriptions, and a 'Book Now' button, which links directly down to the suite Booking Enquiry Form at the bottom of the page.

  - As you can see in the image below, as the Suites page is the current page, the 'Book a Suite' button is underlined on the navbar button so that it is clear to the user at a glance which page they are on, and also the dropdown menu arrow has appeared beside it.

![Mockups of Suites Page on various screen sizes](assets/images/readme/mockups/suites-page.png)

- A Suite **Booking Enquiry Form*** with dropdown menu to pick a suite to enquire about, which link to the **Success/Thank You Page** when correctly submitted.

Featuring:
- A large bubble **Page Title** which disappears and is instead incorporated into the navbar on smaller screen sizes.
- **5 Class Options*** which are all fully responsive, so the image is inside the description box in a mobile/tablet screen, and then on larger screens the images pop out of the text box and appear beside, increasing/decreasing from 1 to 4 depending on the screen size, to match the height of the description bubble. As well as related images, these all have titles, descriptions, which trainer/trainers that will take the class (including a link to the specific trainer on the main home page), and a 'Book Now' button, which links directly down to the Booking Form at the bottom of the page.

![Mockups of Classes Page on various screen sizes](assets/images/readme/mockups/classes-page.png)

<summary>Warning Message that I fixed</summary>

![Section lacks Heading Warning](assets/images/readme/testing/w3c/html-header-warning.png)

I had 3 of these warnings, for the 2 continued sections that I needed to split due to the background image being too zoomed in otherwise ('Our Activities' and 'Our Trainers'). I added an `id` to each section to make it clear for screen readers and accessibility, and also added a hidden header for extra clarity and so there were no errors or warnings in the tests.

## W3C CSS Validation Service

The CSS stylesheet passes the CSS Validation Service.

![CSS Validation Pass](assets/images/readme/testing/w3c/css-pass.png)

There were some warnings which are due to using CSS variables and imported stylesheets from Bootstrap, which aren't anything to worry about.

## Lighthouse Performance

When testing my website with Lighthouse, I encountered an issue, which I fixed (fixed scores below) which affected the 'Best Practices' score, as shown below:

<details>
<summary>Click for old test results</summary>

![Issue Description](assets/images/readme/testing/lighthouse/lighthouse-best-practices-issue.png)
</details><br>

This was due to `h1` elements being used within a `section` element, so by changing all the `h2`s to `h3`s and `h1`s in my `section`s to `h2`s, this fixed the issue, giving me the scores below for each of the pages:

## WAVE Test

<details>
<summary>False Contrast Errors</summary>

![Wave Test False Fail Summary](assets/images/readme/testing/wave/false-fail-summary.png)

**Issue** The only contrast errors were caused by the visually hidden headers I had added during the W3C HTML Validation test just above, which I discovered when inspecting the code shown below:

![False Contrast Errors](assets/images/readme/testing/wave/false-fail.png)

**Solution** I got around these errors by adding a colour to these headers by adding a colour to the headings in the HTML using the `style` attribute.

```html
<section id="hero" class="hero m-0 p-0">
    <h2 class="visually-hidden" style="color: black;">Hero Image</h2>
```
</details><br>

After I added the code to fix these 'errors', these were my test results:

### Home Page

There were **no Errors** or **Contrast Errors** in the Home Page.

|  |  |
| :---: | :---: |
| ![Home Page Summary](assets/images/readme/testing/wave/home-page-summary.png) | ![Home Page Details](assets/images/readme/testing/wave/home-page-details.png) |

The Alerts above are due to the links to the Suites page at the bottom of the Activity text bubbles, as the link is on the word "here", which the testing tool isn't sure if will be clear to users. However, I believe this is clear enough as it is clearly specified in the words before the link.

The other Alerts were due to the links being to the same place at the bottom of each text box, which was also intentional and doesn't cause a problem.

![Alerts from Home Page Wave Tests](assets/images/readme/testing/wave/home-page-alerts.png)

### Suites Page

There were **no Errors** or **Contrast Errors** in the Suites Page.

The Alerts in this page were again only caused by 'redundant'/duplicate links from the 'Book Now' buttons at the bottom of each Suite description, which takes you to the booking enquiry form at the bottom of the page, which I am happy with and will leave as it is.

<details>
<summary>Fixed 'Possible Heading' Alerts</summary>

![Classes Page Summary](assets/images/readme/testing/wave/classes-page-summary-before.png)

There were some 'Possible Heading' Alerts on this page, which I amended by changing some of the paragraphs (`p` tags) with the `.lead` class to `h3` size headers with the `.lead` class instead.

Before:
```html
<p class="lead mb-1">with Trainer&nbsp;Lana</p>
```
After:
```html
<h4 class="lead mb-1">with Trainer&nbsp;Lana</h4>
```
</details><br>

There were also 'Suspicious Link Text' Alerts from the links on the word "here" again, but it is explained in the words before, so I am happy to leave that as it is.

The 'Redundant Link' Alert again is only caused by duplicate links from the 'Book Now' buttons at the bottom of each Suite description, which takes you to the booking enquiry form at the bottom of the page, which again, I am happy with and will leave as it is.

## WebAIM Contrast Checker Test

I changed the original dark brown colour I had chosen for my paragraph text colour after testing from `#84644B` to `#674A18` due to the original colour not passing all of the contrast checker tests on the [WebAIM Contrast Checker](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/) website, and I wanted my website to be as accessible as possible for all users.

Below is an image of the new, slightly darker brown colour passing all of the tests on this website:

# Fixed Issues

### VS Code Extension *'Prettier'* adding unnecessary closing tags

<details>
<summary>Issue & Solution:</summary>

**Issue:** As part of the course material, I installed a code refactoring extension called 'Prettier' in VS Code, but had issues with this adding unnecessary closing tags (`/>`) to all of the self-closing elements, such as `meta` and `img`.

These were added every time I formatted my pages, and resulted in errors in the [W3C Testing](#w3c-markuphtml-validation-service) stage, wasting time with having to remove each time I formatted.

**Solution:** I uninstalled this extension and opted to use the default formatter, which worked a lot better.

### Unable to change/remove background of Navbar
<details>
<summary>Issue & Solution:</summary>

**Issue:** When I had added the bamboo background image to the header section, I noticed the navbar from Bootstrap I had added within this had it's own white colour background, which stopped the image being shown as a background for the whole thing, even if I tried to change it to transparent using my CSS stylesheet.

![Navbar background being overridden by Bootstrap](assets/images/readme/issues/removing-navbar-background.png)

**Solution:** I checked using Devtools and noticed that the background colour was being set my a bootstrap scss file, and that this was set as `!important;` so would override any background I added. Looking further I spotted it was being added because of the `.bg-body-tertiary` class, so once I removed this, the background image covered the whole title & nav section, including the navbar.

### Icons from Bootstrap couldn't be coloured

<details>
<summary>Issue & Solution:</summary>

**Issue:** I was unable to colour the burger icon of the icon that I got from Bootstrap's navbar code, or the dropdown split button arrow icons.

**Solution:** I inspected with Chrome **DevTools** and saw that the bootstrap burger icon was an image so I wouldn't be able to change the colour of that, so I decided to change the icon to a **Font Awesome** icon instead, which I know are customisable/colourable as text is. I also did the same with the small arrows in the split buttons that are used to open the button's dropdown menu, so that I could colour them all consistently.

**Steps:**
At first I made a class with the chosen colour called `.text-sand` which I added as a class to the span element which also had a `.navbar-toggler-icon` class.

![Original code with .navbar-toggler-icon](assets/images/readme/issues/colouring-burger-icon/code-original.png)

I then got rid of the `.navbar-toggler-icon` class which was creating the image, and added my chosen Font Awesome icon code inside the `span`.

![Code with added Font Awesome Icon](assets/images/readme/issues/colouring-burger-icon/code-added-icon.png)

I checked this worked, and it did, then tried moving all the classes to the newly added `i` element from Font Awesome instead to see if I still needed the `span`, and after checking, this still worked, so I removed the redundant `span` element.

![Final code with span element removed](assets/images/readme/issues/colouring-burger-icon/code-final.png)

| This is now the output on the website: | After border has been added: |
| :---: | :---: |
| ![Coloured burger icon](assets/images/readme/issues/colouring-burger-icon/burger-before-border.png) | ![Coloured burger icon with border](assets/images/readme/issues/colouring-burger-icon/burger-after-border.png) |

**Later Change:**
Later on I decided to change the `.text-sand` class to instead target all `i` elements which are a child of the `.navbar` class, which reduced and tidied the code and would make it easier to keep the colouring consistent if adding any more icons to the navbar in future.

The CSS code used to style the navbar icons:
```css
/* Navbar Arrows and Burger Icon */
.navbar i {
    color: var(--primary-sand);
}

/* Navbar Burger Icon */
.burger-icon {
    border: solid 4px var(--primary-sand);
    margin-bottom: 0.5rem;
    padding: 0.25rem 0.75rem;
}
```

### Bootstrap's Active page not visible

<details>
<summary>Issue & Solution:</summary>

**Issue:** When customising the navbar from bootstrap, I changed the font/button border/hover colours, which meant the active page colour wasn't visible anymore, but I still wanted users to be able to see clearly from a glance which page they were on just from looking at the navbar.

**Solution:** I decided to add in my own effect, by adding an underline to the button text of the current page button.

I experimented with adding an underline using `border-bottom: 4px solid var(--primary-sand);` and `text-decoration: underline;`, and although I liked the `border-bottom` effect, this didn't work with the buttons, as they already had a full border, so I decided to go for the underline option.

```css
border-bottom: 4px solid var(--primary-sand);
```

```css
text-decoration: underline;
text-decoration-thickness: 3px;
```

Before:

![Underline before](assets/images/readme/issues/active-page/underline-before.png)

I found it didn't look quite right as the underline was a little too close to the text, but after some research online I discovered there was a way to lower the underline by adding `text-underline-position: under;` - which after checking - I felt this worked perfectly for what I was going for, so this is the code I decided to implement for the final project

```css
.navbar .btn.active {
    text-decoration: underline;
    text-decoration-thickness: 3px;
    text-underline-position: under;
}
```

After:

### Page Title inside Navbar not properly centralised

<details>
<summary>Issue & Solution:</summary>

**Issue:** Because of the burger icon being to the right of the same navbar section that the page title appears in on smaller screens (mobile and tablet), the title wasn't appearing properly centralised as it was being pushed too far to the left.

**Solution:** I fixed this by adding padding to the left of the page title which matched the width of the burger icon, centralising it correctly to match the title above.
I added a class to the page title, and added `padding-left` of the same width of the burger icon.

| Page Title too far to the left: | Page title centralised with left-padding added: |
| :---: | :---: |
| ![Page Title with no padding](assets/images/readme/issues/page-title-center/issue-page-title-no-padding.png) | ![Page Title centralised with left padding](assets/images/readme/issues/page-title-center/issue-page-title-left-padding.png) |
```css
.page-title {
    padding-left: 28.4px;
}
```
This also had to be amended to match the burger icon's new width on a larger screen, as I added padding to the x-axis at the mobile to tablet breakpoint. I checked the width of the burger icon at each breakpoint using Chrome DevTools (shown below).

| Smaller burger icon without extra padding in the x-axis: | Smaller burger icon with extra padding in the x-axis: |
| :---: | :---: |
| ![Smaller burger icon without extra padding in the x-axis](assets/images/readme/issues/page-title-center/issue-burger-icon-small.png) | ![Smaller burger icon with extra padding in the x-axis](assets/images/readme/issues/page-title-center/issue-burger-icon-large.png) |
```css
@media (max-width: 426px) {
    .page-title {
    padding-left: 36px;
    }

    /* Burger Icon (makes smaller) */
    .burger-icon {
        padding: 0 0.5rem 0.15rem 0.5rem;
    }
}
```

### Dropdown Menu in navbar being cut off

<details>
<summary>Issue & Solution:</summary>

**Issue:**  When the right dropdown menu is opened, some of the menu text is cut off by the edge of the screen. This occurs because the dropdown button is positioned close to the screen edge, and the menu options are too long to fit within the visible area. By default, Bootstrap dropdown menus are left-aligned. If a dropdown is near the right edge and the menu options are lengthy, the menu will overflow and appear clipped, making some text not fully visible.

![Dropdown Menu being cut off](assets/images/readme/issues/right-align-before.png)

**Solution:**  After consulting the Bootstrap documentation, I discovered that adding the `.dropdown-menu-end` class to the same element as `dropdown-menu` changes the alignment of the dropdown menu to the right, instead of the default left alignment. This prevents the menu from being cut off at the edge of the screen. I applied this fix only to the two rightmost navbar dropdown menus, while keeping the left-side dropdowns left-aligned. This approach maintains visual consistency across the navbar and avoids potential overflow issues on either side.

![Dropdown Menu fixed](assets/images/readme/issues/right-align-after.png)

Later, I also updated the navbar alignment to better match the rest of the site's layout by changing the class `.container-fluid` to `.container` in the navbar, which added more space between the buttons and edges of the screen and helped the navbar appear more consistent with the more centralised page content.

### Background Image pixelated on small screens

<details>
<summary>Issue & Solution:</summary>
**Issue:** The background image was becoming overly stretched due to the tall page content - particularly on mobile devices where stacked boxes increased the overall height. As a result, the image appeared excessively zoomed in and pixelated, diminishing its visual quality.

|  |  |
| :---: | :---: |
| ![Image showing background image appearing too zoomed in and pixelated](assets/images/readme/issues/background-too-zoomed/issue-background-too-zoomed-before.png) | ![Image showing background image appearing too zoomed in and pixelated](assets/images/readme/issues/background-too-zoomed/issue-background-too-zoomed-before-two.png) |

**Solution:** I resolved this issue by splitting the content into separate sections, and adding the background image to each section, instead of having all of the content in one giant section with just one background image.

I found that having around two of the text boxes in each worked well on all screen sizes, so none were too tall for the image, eliminating the need to change the amount of sections depending on screen sizes, which I did consider, but would have added a lot more code and been more complex than necessary.

### Added gaps interfering with Bootstrap flexbox spacing

<details>
<summary>Issue & Solution:</summary>

**Issue:** After I decided to add universal gaps and spacing between all items in my text bubbles (I added `gap: 20px;` to the `.row` class), I noticed that some of the bootstrap flexbox items weren't appearing correctly, for example. the input boxes in my forms didn't appear side by side anymore, even though the column sizes didn't add up to more than 12.

![Image showing 2 .col-6 text boxes not appearing in line](assets/images/readme/issues/added-gaps-interfering-with-flex/columns-appearing-wrong.png)

**Solution:** To fix this issue I changed the column size numbers (eg. `.col-6`) to numbers that added up to 11 instead of 12 per row, to account for the added gap, so instead of 2 `.col-6`s in a row I changed it to `.col-6` and `.col-5` or 2 `.col-5`s. This fixed the issue, and after altering the other text boxes to match these new sizes, the forms looked great again.
</details>

---

### Navbar Split Buttons don't work visually on smaller screen sizes

<details>
<summary>Issue & Solution:</summary>

**Issue:** When the burger icon is open, the split buttons within this weren't reacting well, expanding the menu strangely when dropdown menu open. The dropdown menu that opens when clicking the arrow didn't open *over* the other menu options/buttons, it pushed them all down.

**Solution:** I decided to change these buttons to just normal navbar links when the screen is small enough to use the burger icon, as the border on the buttons didn't look as good to me when stacked vertically in an open burger menu, and the padding around made it taller than it needed to be too.
I refined the options down to only the most important, instead of all buttons and dropdown menu options, so that the stacked list wasn't too long, and also ensured the were centralised.

| Before | Before (with open split button dropdown menu) | After |
| :---: | :---: | :---: |
| ![Burger Menu Options Before](assets/images/readme/issues/burger-menu/open-burger-menu-before.png) | ![Burger Menu Options Before with open split button dropdown menu](assets/images/readme/issues/burger-menu/open-burger-menu-before-dropdown.png) | ![Burger Menu Options After](assets/images/readme/issues/burger-menu/open-burger-menu-after.png) |

**How I did this:** To do this I added a new navbar unordered list with the links I wanted to show instead, and I changed the visibility to only appear when on the smaller screen sizes, and edited the split buttons to only show on larger screen sizes, when the burger icon isn't visible.

```html
d-none d-lg-block
```
I added this to the left and right `div` elements containing my current split nav buttons in the navbar. This means `display-none` and `display-large-block`, which stops it being visible until it gets to a 'large' or larger screen, which is the breakpoint that the navbar menu switches from having links in a burger menu, to being buttons.

```html
d-block d-lg-none
```
I added this to the `ul` container for new links that I wanted to show when clicking on the burger icon at smaller screens.

</details>

---

### `display: none` not working at breakpoints

<details>
<summary>Issue & Solution:</summary>

**Issue:** I had an issue with items in the navbar not disappearing/appearing at the chosen breakpoints I had set.

I originally set some items in the navbar (such as the page title in the navbar and main section or buttons) to appear/disappear using a media query class which matched the specified breakpoint on Bootstrap for `lg`, as shown in the code below:

```css
@media (max-width: 992px) {
    .main-page-title {
        display: none;
    }
}
```
![Bootstrap Breakpoints](assets/images/readme/issues/breakpoints-bootstrap.png)

However, I couldn't get everything to work as I wanted - there was always one exact screen size where elements wouldn't behave properly. Even when adjusting the breakpoint by 1px up or down, something would fail to appear or disappear as expected.

The image below shows both page titles being visible - when 1 of them should be hidden if the other one visible.

![Page Titles both appearing at the same time](assets/images/readme/issues/breakpoint-error.png)

**Solution:** The issue stemmed from the navbar switching to a burger icon at the `lg` breakpoint, while other elements controlled by CSS media queries didn't always sync perfectly, resulting in a mismatch at a specific screen width.

So I decided not to mix bootstrap breakpoints and media query breakpoints, changing the `.disappear-tablet` class to a pre-set class designed by Bootstrap to hide/reveal elements - `.d-none .d-lg-block` - which worked, and meant everything appeared/disappeared as it should.

</details>

---

### Text bubble height mismatched with height of images

<details>
<summary>Issue & Solution:</summary>

**Issue:** At certain screen sizes, the text box was either too long or too short compared to the adjacent images, causing unwanted gaps, either between images or within the text box.

**Solution:** I solved this problem by setting some of the images to appear/disappear depending on the size of the screen, using bootstrap classes added to the image element.

```html
class="img-fluid floating-section d-none d-lg-block d-xl-none"
```

I also added space between images with `d-flex flex-column justify-content-evenly` so that the gap was dispersed between each image vertically, making any gaps appear less, rather than showing up more obviously at the bottom.

I then did the same to the titles, paragraphs and buttons in the text bubbles by also adding `d-flex flex-column justify-content-evenly` to all article elements which contain the headers and paragraphs so that the content is aligned correctly vertically, with even gaps throughout, rather than another unsightly gap at the bottom if the box is too big.

| | |
| :---: | :---: |
| ![Text box gaps before](assets/images/readme/issues/textbox-and-images-gaps/text-gaps-before.png) | [Text box gaps after](assets/images/readme/issues/textbox-and-images-gaps/text-gaps-after.png) |

I chose `justify-content-evenly` instead of `center`, as it worked better to spread the items better, leaving less gaps, and then by adding/removing images at certain screen sizes I made it so that there were never any noticeable gaps, no matter the screen size.

`justify-content-start` is the default, but as you can see from this Bootstrap image below, it means content is bunched together (at the top in this case as I has changed the flex direction to column)

# Deployment

The following steps outline how I created my project and cloned it locally from GitHub. You can use equivalent tools, apps, or platforms based on your own device or preferences.

**GitHub**

- Firstly, I made a new repository in GitHub from the code institute template, with my chosen name for my project, which is `pokemon-island-resort`
    - I ensured that this was in *snake case*.

- I then copied the GitHub repository URL from the top of the page, as shown below.

![Copying URL from GitHub repository](assets/images/readme/deployment/copying-url.png)

**File Explorer**

- Once I had made a new repository, in 'File Explorer' on my local Windows device, I then navigated to the folder I wanted my project to be in, and right clicked to 'Open in Terminal'.

![Right clicking in chosen folder to open in Terminal](assets/images/readme/deployment/opening-terminal.png)

**Terminal**

- Then, after making sure I was still in the correct folder, I typed `git clone [link copied and pasted from GitHub address bar]` into the Terminal.

![Cloning repository in the Terminal](assets/images/readme/deployment/terminal-cloning.png)

- This is what it should look like if this has worked correctly.

![Finished cloning repository in the Terminal](assets/images/readme/deployment/terminal-cloning-finished.png)

- Now a new folder will have been added to your 'File Explorer' which is linked to the GitHub repository.

![Newly created project folder](assets/images/readme/deployment/new-project-folder.png)

**VS Code**

- Next, I opened the new project folder in my chosen IDE (in my case this is VS Code) and pushed to GitHub to ensure the connection had been made.

Then I set up the initial project structure:

- I created the main html page: `index.html`, and created the `assets` folder which I added a `css` folder and an `images` folder inside.

- I added a `style.css` stylesheet inside the `css` folder and linked it to my `index.html` file, testing that the link had worked.

- I integrated Bootstrap and Font Awesome by linking them into my `index.html`, and also imported my chosen Google Fonts to the `style.css` stylesheet by adding the import URL to the top.

- In my custom CSS file (`style.css`), I defined the color palette and font styles as CSS variables to ensure consistent branding and design.

- After verifying that all dependencies and styles were correctly linked, I staged, committed, and pushed these initial changes to the GitHub repository.
